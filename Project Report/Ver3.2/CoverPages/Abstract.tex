Highlights of significant contributions: One page with 3 to 4 paragraphs\\

Paragraph 1: Importance of Topic, Present shortcomings in performance or computation etc, issues involved in the shortcomings, short on what is done in this report addressing shortcomings


Paragraph 2 Objectives of this work, short on algebraic methods used and formulations achieved, computational procedures developed. \gls{ic}.


Paragraph 3: Description of simulation procedure including SW tools used and choice of test cases. Short on results achieved and significant highlights of improvements if any.
\gls{ic}

Paragraph 4:The last para needed only if emulation (after simulation) or Hardware developed to validate simulation results in para 3.
